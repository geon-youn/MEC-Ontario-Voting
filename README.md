"With the recent federal election taking Canadians back to the voting booths, many
voters were left in long lines during the pandemic and stations were forced to keep polls
open. Many opted to send their ballots in the mail which ensured their safety and that
their votes were counted. In a digital age, where sharing ideas is so easy, voting
shouldnâ€™t have to be so complicated."

*Valid vote: voter has only voted once and for a single candidate
Party names: 'Socks and Crocs Reform League', 'Pineapple Pizza Party', 'Pronounced Jiff

vote count
