"With the recent federal election taking Canadians back to the voting booths, many
voters were left in long lines during the pandemic and stations were forced to keep polls
open. Many opted to send their ballots in the mail which ensured their safety and that
their votes were counted. In a digital age, where sharing ideas is so easy, voting
shouldnâ€™t have to be so complicated."

1. Process through given voter data and count and display valid votes* on a GUI
*Valid vote: voter has only voted once and for a single candidate
Party names: 'Socks and Crocs Reform League', 'Pineapple Pizza Party', 'Pronounced Jiff
Union'
2. Design a system to authenticate identity of a user by taking username and a photo
of an ID card and checking that the names match
3. Allow authenticated user to vote for a fictional party, which is then added to the
vote count
